Recursion 
def groundhog_day(): defines a function named groundhog_day with no parameters.
print('Did you mean: groundhog day ?') places that line to the console
time.sleep(1) pauses the program for 1 second before continuing.
groundhog_day() calls the same function from inside itself: this is recursion. Since there’s no stop condition (no if that eventually avoids calling groundhog_day() again), the function will call itself forever until Python crashes with a RecursionError or the program is stopped.



A function is a comment that is going to do a set of instructions
Indentation matters 

Docstring is the comment for what the function does
How to bring in docstring ‘’’
import time :Brings in Python’s built‑in time module so you can use time.sleep() to pause execution.

Required to write docstring for every function I create

Int and float are both types of data
Int stores whole numbers
Float stores decimal
RAM is expensive but we need to store the data
a  = 1
b = 1.0 
c = “1.0” 
c * 3 = 1.01.01.0

import sys
sys.getsizeof(a)
will get you how much size this function takes
what does 17 % 5 return? Why? 
It is  a modulo or mod operator 
It gives you the remainder after the integer division 15/5 , 17- 15 = 2 
17/5 
3.4
17//5 
3



a = input ("Enter an integer:")

# check odd or even 
if a % 2 == 0: 
    print("Even")
else:
    print("odd")
there will be an error 
you need to convert a into an integer 
control i activates copilot
what is the basic error handling mechanism in python? A specific example and a simple example should be provided
try : 
except 
/ vs // , division vs floor division 
Which variable name is better and why? x vs student_count
student_count  variable name should be understandable
>>> for i in range(4): 
	Print(i)
Then its ok, since all you want is to print the number
Names = (‘renee”, “amelia:, “aurora”)
for x in names:
# loop over
Print(name) 

Now the code is easier to read, like reading English
What is the difference between an expression and a statement 
Expression evaluates to 3 but does not do anything/ print anything on console
Eg 1+a 
Print (1+a) is a statement, which prints the result 
Try things, see what happens, learn 
== whether its true or false
True is Boolean 
How do we store and name things ?
	It cant start with a number, lowercase letters and numbers and cant have spaces
Camel style naming 
Python use a snakestyle
Forbidden words we cant use for variable names
Ide  color will be different 
Ctrl / comments out the whole block of code 
# TODO: do something

# a product would close $100, how much tax do we pay? 

product = 100 # in dollars
tax_rate = 0.0625
tax = product * tax_rate
print (f'The tax for the product which costs ${product} is ${tax}. ')
so what happens if you have multiple variables? 
You use a common variable to streamline the process

f = f string

make sure function is not indented 
# if the function does not explicitly return any value, it would return none
Return vs print 
calc_tax (computer_price)
calc_tax(iphone_price)

total_tax = calc_tax(computer_price) + calc_tax (iphone_price)
print (total_tax)
