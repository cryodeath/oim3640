# Week 4 2/12/2026 - (Topics)
Chapter 6 - Return Values
Chapter 5 - Conditionals



## What I learned this week 
Next time we are asked what we think of AI
Ask questions, what kind of AI? 
PRD Produce Requirement Document
Please torture the AI, get value out of it and try to automate my tasks if possible 
b > 5 --> False
Type class 'bool' if 
b = 3
e = b > 5
if it was string it would be an error 
Mini projects required (3) + 1/2 elective mini projects (4-5) 
1. My first Python App 
2. Text Analysis
3. Web App 
Build a python program that is terminal based, taking user input, processes it and produces it 
Start with the proposal first, then code iteratively 
Python is on github, c is used to build python
C is a low level language, C is build using assembly
Binary --> Assembly --> C --> Python --> natural language
0.1 + 0.2 gives you 0.3xxxx4 , computer use binary to convert integer and decimal loss of precision 
This happens in all programming languages that use floating point decimals, not just in putjon 
To avoid this error, using the decimal library if precision mattters to your program 
f string is needed in this class if we want to avoid not precise answers

result = 0.1 + 0.2
print (result)
print(f'{result:2f}')
math library is important 
wrap code into function

python -m turtledemo but exit python first by writing exit or quit 

To do big tasks eg big drone show, you decompose the tasks
test functions out 
= is assigning 
== is equality 
!= is not eautl

first matching conddition matters, done with the entire code. Not checking the entire code
not about memorizing the syntax its about making sure the logic is correct

next week going to learn iterations

## Code I'm proud of (optional)
(A snippet + what it does and why)

## Challenges I faced 
(What was hard? How did I work through it?)

## AI Usage 
(How I s)

## Questions moving forward
