Python has a bunch of arithmetic operators, and the order of operations matters (exponentiation first, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction).

I now see the difference between integers, floats, and strings, and how type(), int(), and float() help me understand and convert between them.

Variables are just names pointing to values, created with name = something, and once they exist I can reuse them in expressions and function calls instead of retyping the raw values.

Some words are off‑limits as variable names because they’re Python keywords, and even though I can use names like int or str, it’s a bad habit because it hides the built‑in functions.

I learned how to bring in extra functionality with import math and then use things like math.pi and math.sqrt() with the dot notation.

I’m getting a feel for the difference between expressions (which produce values) and statements (which do something), and how print() is used when I actually want to show results.

The three error types : syntax, runtime, and semantic, help me categorize what went wrong instead of seeing all errors as the same thing.
